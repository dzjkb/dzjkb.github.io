### ergodox
oh shit a lighter travel version
https://www.zsa.io/voyager
365 USD => 1350 PLN not bad not bad
- [used on allegro ~1k](https://allegrolokalnie.pl/oferta/klawiatura-mechaniczna-ergonomiczna-split-zsa-voyager-rgb-lowprofile)
how does it "tent" (lol) though? what about the wrist rests (or lack thereof)?
- https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/faqs/index.html#should-i-use-a-wrist-rest
- "hovering like a piano player is good" ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/17oca43/split_tenting_keyboard_without_rest/))
- might make sense actually
- https://danieldk.eu/ZSA-Voyager-Review
- I could [print something to tent more](https://www.zsa.io/voyager/printables), but still no palm rest
- maybe tenting more than the 5 degrees isn't necessary if I put it close + at shoulder width?
    - would be great to test this out

the EZ is cheaper actually
- less portability
- some people complain about the sound/noise

and the moonlander is the same (365 USD) price huh

shit https://www.rtings.com/headphones/tools/compare/bowers-wilkins-px7-wireless-vs-sony-wh-1000xm4-wireless/1619/16490?usage=32776
Xm4's really showing up strong here

reddit generally [agrees](https://www.reddit.com/r/sony/comments/if6zh3/sony_wh1000mx4_vs_bowers_wilkins_px7/) that the Px7's have better sound quality, but worse ANC (even requiring ANC to be off for the good quality?), worse features
the Sony's also seem more comfortable, lighter, more bass-boosted (typical) but I could eq that out
[this review](https://www.whathifi.com/advice/sony-wh-1000xm4-vs-bowers-and-wilkins-px7-which-is-better) corroborates that, but also says Sony's are better quality because of the "punch", ugh
