## primary
### reconstruction quality - quantitative eval 1
multiscale spectral loss
### diversity, novelty - quantative eval 2
developing new and/or comparing measures for this
listed in [[diversity metrics]]
### new kind of dataset
and possible method changes to accomodate the new problem
- Irisarri
- percussive sounds
- sound fx stuff - glitches?
    - loads of packs to work off of too, probably
- Hecker
## secondary
### meaningful latent space
any ways to actually shape it? try forcing a dimension to correspond to some abstract concepts (intensity? color? texture?) and see what happens?
### architecture improvements
improving VAEs, probably mainly through making the pior more sophisticated? maybe by adding new DDSP components compared to RAVE?
# non-goals
- real-time generation
- usable modules? at least for now, would be nice to do later
