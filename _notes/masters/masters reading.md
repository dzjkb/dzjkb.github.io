### general
[Learning meaningful representations for protein sequences](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359819766_Learning_meaningful_representations_of_protein_sequences)
- why is this here again?
- maybe a more pleasant version from [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29443-w)
### normalizing flows / priors
[Variational Autoencoders with riemann brownian motion priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05227)

[Variational Autoencoders with Normalizing Flow Decoders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05617v1)

[Variational Inference with Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05770)
- implementation of the idea: https://github.com/fmu2/flow-VAE, adding normalizing flows to classic VAE
