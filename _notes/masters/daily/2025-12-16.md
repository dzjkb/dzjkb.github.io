## experiments
todo:
- single latent?
    - would be nice, but graz is probably a really tough dataset for this
- with discriminator warmup
- unconditional gen
    - after single latent
## sem prez
ideas
1. creative music AI perspective
2. normalizing flows + VAEs + music
3. evaluation methods - embeddings, FAD
4. modeling music in different domains

or maybe presenting some of the new interesting works
maybe connected to point 1
## conceptualizing
[[Thesis overview]]
I'd need to really understand what can I do with normalizing flows to write something about them
## normalizing flows
concept
- decoder would be able to learn the flow?
- ~~oh shit, but the flow is _before_ the sampling step~~
    - or not wait
- but the flow is way more expressive than the upsampling FC or transposed convs hmmmm idk
- I should read the papers
## misc
god I should try to prepare some actual sfx/synth/sth sample dataset since I'm talking about them so much
