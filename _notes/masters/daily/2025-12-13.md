## experiments
ok ok mono learns way better, at 4.1 validation loss already
uhhhhhhh what do I do with this information idk

at 76$ already jfc ok enough

**single latent**
current latent freq is 100Hz, so 100x compression -> increase the latent size a bit maybe?
## unconditional generation
ok I can kind of hear the piano but there's no coherence in the sample
kind of sounds like this average over the whole thing
## embeddings
fadtk KID ok ok but I need reasonable unconditional generation first
so single latent experiments oh boy
## conceptualizing
