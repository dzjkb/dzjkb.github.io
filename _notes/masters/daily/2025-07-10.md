### snares
holy shit it sounds like it's actually starting to fit well
- the sounds are super similar, not bit-crushed anymore
- just a tiny tiny bit, you have to listen side by side to see what the difference is from the original
and it's even starting to overfit slightly?
- it's a bit like the validation loss doesn't exactly reflect the quality though
seems the reasonable range of loss values is different than for `graz`
anyway, this means latent space generation experiments??

would need
- a way to load only the decoder
- a script that draws some zs, launches the decoder and saves the results (is PT useful here? inference mode or sth?)
can I just draw from `N(0, 1)` though? [[RAVE]] would suggest not, what do the other VAE works suggest?
### graz
try less weight on the latent loss - running
### evaluation
[mean opinion score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_opinion_score)
[mushra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSHRA) - used by [[SoundStream]]
### further model improvements
gather them in one place - [[VAE architecture]]
[[SoundStream]] also uses a discriminator rightt might be the next step
- or not really, quality is something I can take care of a lot further down the line, since the thesis won't be mainly about the reconstruction quality
