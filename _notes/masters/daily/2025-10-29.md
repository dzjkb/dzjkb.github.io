## goals
pretty clear, tasks are listed in [[what do (masters)]] - on hold right now
next step would be metrics
## discriminators fr
ok time to actually learn how it's done - feature losses? optimizer steps? uhhhhhhh
- mmkay https://beckham.nz/2021/06/28/training-gans.html
- [original spectral norm paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05957)
    - includes a comparison with `weight_norm` which is used in [[RAVE]], why?
    - maybe this is an improvement to make? this was surely thought through in [[RVQGAN]] though, investigate

and then, code-wise:
- copy over MSD, MRD and MRSD from [[RAVE]] (or descriptor?)
- add discriminator step
- add the freeze/warmup/sth callback parameter step etc.
### spectral norm vs weight norm

summary
- weight norm reduces the weight matrix rank
- which in turn reduces the numbers of features we actually use for discrimination?
idk might be worth testing this empirically anyway
