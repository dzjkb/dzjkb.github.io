## goals
pretty clear, tasks are listed in [[what do (masters)]] - on hold right now
next step would be metrics
## discriminators fr
ok so uhhh
get going with the implementation fr
[[RVQGAN]] uses `**2` for the critic output terms, [[RAVE]] uses `relu`
- doesn't that suddenly cut the loss at some point? mmkay w/e maybe that's a stability thing

how to train discs with Lightning? have to do own `.backward()`s!?
