## experiments
running this validation loop bro
## dataset
bro [[Crash]] uses the same dataset as [[DrumGAN]] I gotta get on it bro
both works are from Sony CSL shit this might not be so open

ok ok apparently freesound has also a 10k one-shot percussive set
https://zenodo.org/records/3665275

Foley sounds yes yes yes that's it
there have to be large datasets for this
!! https://dcase.community/challenge2023/task-foley-sound-synthesis
https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12521
https://zenodo.org/records/8091972
4GB of files
only 7 classes eh

oh shi oh shi FSD50K
https://zenodo.org/records/4060432
sound events, but also musical instruments
200 classes, 144 leaf nodes 56 intermediate nodes
lessssgoooooooo

the general trend is that these works use closed datasets (commercial, bought samples - copyright), which would mean I could probably do the same?
## misc
some reading
- big-ass survey from 2024 on music foundation models https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14340
- foley sound modeling https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09294 (conditioned on temporal events)

oh shit a DDSP works review????
https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/signal-processing/articles/10.3389/frsip.2023.1284100/full
that's a lot of papers, who would've thought
- [ddsp on foley sounds](https://reinliu.github.io/DDSP-SFX/)
- [ddsp for drum sounds](https://jordieshier.com/projects/differentiable_transient_synthesis/)
sound effect synthesis with differential multiband noise synthesiser????????
- can't find the paper shit

oh shit neural audio synthesis for sound effects?????
[[Neural Audio Synthesis for Sound Effects - A Scope Review]]
fuck, exactly the same architecture I'm doing for drum sounds
- [ ] read [Drum Synthesis and Rhythmic Transformation with Adversarial Autoencoders](https://www.open-access.bcu.ac.uk/12287/1/Tomczak_ACMMM20.pdf)
- trained on drum loops
- VAE conditioned on "rhythmic pattern labels" and timbral properties
- ok wait [Adversarial Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05644) are a bit of a different concept, relaxing the iso gaussian constraint on the prior
- bit of a different domain but then lots of similarities, might be worth checking out for inspiration
a different review, looks potentially nice for conceptual stuff
https://iris.uniroma1.it/handle/11573/1701262

ohhh you \*, PhD thesis eh Antoine
https://theses.hal.science/tel-04137258v1/file/CAILLON_Antoine_these_2023.pdf
some more [[RAVE]] analysis, nice
a whole section on real-time, cached paddings
temporal learning, not sure what's that about
dudes fucking doing live sets as a part of his PhD I want in on this

bro a whole other PhD thesis from Sorbonne on [Generative Adversarial Networks for Synthesis and Control of Drum Sounds](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04511699/)??????
what
bro has a whole section on datasets, yisssss

codecs continued
[sDiff-Codec](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10694300)

oh shi oh shi
- [ ] read [Latent Space Exploration for Drum Samples](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10859217)
- that previous paper about fader network or sth too remember
