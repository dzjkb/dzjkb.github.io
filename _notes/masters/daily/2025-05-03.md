~ wilno - [roof storage](https://wypozyczalniaboxow.pl/thule-excellence-xt/)
~ additional 210pln for 5 days, not bad
~ or [this one](https://wypozyczalniaboxow.pl/thule-dynamic-m-dynamic-800/) just 165pln, not sure 180cm is enough for the guitar?

would be nice to get a working version quick
playing around with datasets might be fun
### Encoder
hardcode kernel size? won't be changing much probs, saves a lot of parametrization headache
- soundstream uses 7 throughout, RAVE 3
- might be because RAVE has a 3kHz input after decomposition?
- would suggest using 7 at first

soundstream downsamplings - 2, 4, 5, 8 (= 320 in total)
- starts from 24kHz though, without any decomposition
- nice 75Hz in the end
RAVE downsamplings - 4, 4, 4, 2 (= 128 in total)

almost done actually, nice
### Decoder
