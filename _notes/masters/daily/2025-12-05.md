## decomposition
does this work?

something's up with the dimensions
```
x: torch.Size([3, 2, 144000])
x_hat: torch.Size([3, 2, 143360])
```
640 samples get lost in the process woops
[[RAVE]] does this funny slicing
```
y_multiband = y_multiband[..., :x_multiband.shape[-1]]
```
but it wouldn't even work in my case, other way around

might be because of some rounding?
yep, setting the strides so they divide the sampling rate works

the speedup holy shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
!!!

ok time to actually start adding my own shit oh boy
- I'll have to do the causal thing if we were to do this live motion sensing translation thingy

**experiments**
losses are decreasing on `graz_mini` but the audio is just static, not even the envelopes are audible
ok epoch 400 they're starting to be, there's some hope, let's see where this goes
ok batch size 3 throws OOM you gotta be kidding meee
- slight discriminator size reduction works
- the speed takes a massive hit though goddamn
- ~5s to ~60s, 12x slowdown

ok running a 4+h exp, around 3h encoder training
ok ok it's learning something ????? ma boy?

yeah nothings coming out of this damn, just static, like a slight piano sound at one point
do whole graz
- ~~387~~ 194 steps per epoch
- 40s epoch for encoder training
## latent
single latent - FC, hardcoded length in seconds
- I already configure that in the dataset config

ok uh done does this work too???
I can run my first quality comparison experiment between the two versions
- [x] test single latent, roughly qualitatively compare with the above `graz_mini` run
    - fuc I can do it in parallel on AWS
    - fuc `graz_mini` sux, need to do it on proper `graz`
## unconditional generation
ok ok generating static
but it's kind of enveloped if I sample from the normal distribution, guess that's a good sign?
we'll see with better checkpoints
## later
that phd vid watch
unconditional generation -> normalizing flows -> experiments/metrics
write to MaModrzejewski?
## seminar prez
what can I talk about
- some results would be nice
- normalizing flows
- DrumGAN, RAVE and generally the "creative" audio AI perspective (thx @mamodrzejewski)
## misc
- [x] don't log step metrics (only epoch)
