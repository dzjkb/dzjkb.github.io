## experiments
slightly more capacity?
64 -> 80
ohhhhh what if the differences are also due to trying to do stereo?
- [x] configurable mono

what if I did a "discriminator warmup phase" in which the discriminator is trained but adversarial/feature matching losses aren't used for the generator?
should be like literally a single `if`
## embeddings
using fadtk
`pip install fadtk`
has a python api, see https://github.com/microsoft/fadtk/blob/main/fadtk/model_loader.py
- the CLAP loaded model is the same one, nice
- shit but it requires `torch >= 2.3.0`
- poetry doesn't support multiple versions of the same package in different groups fucc
give up on the `gpu2` torch version?
ok

fadtk
global grad disable in `FrechetAudioDistance` class?
`torch.autograd.set_grad_enabled(False)`
oops, probably shouldn't use that in the validation loop

when do I want to use this stuff
- KID in the validation loop?
- FAD just like uhh somewhere outside
```
fadtk clap-laion-audio /path/to/baseline/audio /path/to/evaluation/audio
```
yeah it's easy maybe I should try running it with `subprocess`
what does [[DrumGAN]] do?
- unconditonal generation based on features from different datasets
- KID and FAD with baseline being training data?
## that guys phd thesis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDfq9bwS6jk Oct 31 fresh as fuck
seminar prez inspo?

"explicit implicit control for expressive ... synthesis"
- explicit - notes, defined knobs etc
- implicit - discovered from data (e.g. latent features in [[RAVE]])

"how can we control the synthesis process?"
- yes
- proposal - combine explicit and implicit controls
MusicControlNet
also using FAD w/ CLAP lesgo
settled on best representation being the complex spectrogram (like that guy earlier) shit
