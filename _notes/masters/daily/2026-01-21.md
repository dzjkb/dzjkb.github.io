## experiments
running validation
shape mismatch why tf
ok ok ok ok fixed

fuckkkkkkkkk the transformers(?) library or sth requires pytorch>=2.1
time to launch AWS again? rip
what now
ok ok ok ok ok
I can save validation audio during training and _then_ calculate embeddings on AWS
- jeez, convoluted
- but ok just saving validation audio makes a lot of sense eh
## dataset
oh shit I can mount through ssh for dataset exploration w/ ranger
```
sshfs -o ro,default_permissions,compression=yes,cache=yes,reconnect,ServerAliveInterval=15,ServerAliveCountMax=3 gpu2:/media/Data/jp_dir/sounds gpu2_mount
```
