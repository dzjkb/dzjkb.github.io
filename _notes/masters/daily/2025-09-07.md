oh god, long time no see
what did I end on?
extracting goals, evaluation methods etc from different works

oh shi https://eu.feelgrounds.com/collections/barefoot-slip-ons-for-women-and-men

### misc stuff
[PerceiverAR (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07765) - modeling soundstream tokens (music is just one of the tested domains, not sure what the main idea is here)

[[RAVE]]
- references WaveGlow re: generation speed
- claims decomposition gives both a speedup as well as higher quality, maybe I should apply it?
### augmentations
from [[RAVE]] - _dequantization, random crop and allpass filters with random coefficient_
### evaluation
papers left to do - [[what do (masters)]] (MelGan, MusicLM, RAVE)
maybe the OGs too - WaveRNN, WaveNet?

focusing on diversity

and then - experiment plan, own goals
list metrics along with goals in [[thesis goals]]

[[MelGAN]]
- note: might have a MOS implementation provided, nice
- pretty much just MOS and some samples srsly ok nice cool
[[musicLM]]
- extends AudioLM into a wider musical domain - something I'm trying to do with [[RAVE]]
- might have a FAD implementation?
- _we also confirm this qualitatively by listening to the samples._
[[RAVE]]
- just MOS and the spectral loss ok

next
- what papers use ViSQOL?
    - or screw ViSQOL actually
- what's mushra exactly?
    - a MOS thing for codecs ok w/e
- update goals <=
- what do with the whole diversity thing - doesn't seem like much of a thing in all of these papers (yay novelty?)
