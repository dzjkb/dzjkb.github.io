(49 + 13) + 10 + (27 + 32 + 27 + 17 + 19 + 27 + 37 + 21 + 24 + 17 + 26) / 4 + 19 - 32

127.5 for Dawid
? for Jim
### callbacks
checkpoints !
quantized encoder - not applicable
warmup - same (yet)

beta warmup - increasing latent regularization
```
initial_value = 1e-6
target_value = 5e-2
warmup_len = 20000
```
will need to tune these parameters probs?
### logging
tensorboard - should be handled nicely by `TensorboardLogger`
log what?
- train loss
- val loss
- all the losses individually
* beta
- audio examples
    - validation
    - ? training
- ? latent space analysis

log the config
oh I'm doing that already
### data
uhhh try the percussive shit first
### future
latent space sampling
- might need to check other works than RAVE that don't do continuous audio but fixed length generation
- sampling a set of independent vectors might not make sense

latent space analysis
normalizing flows

---

ok actually time to download data and run this?
- [x] prepare snare+clap samples dataset
- [x] complete a first training run

debugging ohgod
