please
happens at the encoder downsampling conv
and it seems kind of random

Claude to the rescue?
```
## 2. **Kernel Size vs Stride Mismatch**

Your conv layer uses `kernel_size=2 * stride` with `stride=stride`. This creates a large kernel relative to the stride, which can cause:

- Gradient explosion during backprop
- Numerical instability when stride is large
- Issues if the input sequence length becomes smaller than the kernel size
```
nice try, not so sure though
```
## 1. **Custom Padding Implementation**

The `ZeroPad1d(*_get_strided_padding(stride))` is suspicious. If `_get_strided_padding()` returns incorrect padding values, it could cause:

- Negative padding values (invalid)
- Asymmetric padding that creates dimension mismatches
- Padding that doesn't align with the subsequent conv operation
```
dimension mismatches?

I'd  guess it's something to do with the custom padding too, though
from [[2025-06-13]] - symmetrical padding works too
but this would require even strides
so `[2, 4, 6, 8]` instead of `[2, 4, 5, 8]`, not much of a difference maybe?
### noise
why doesn't Antoine's noise module have the same windowed application (=> time-varying) of the filter as the original ddsp repo does?
Antoine why u do this to me
