in the meantime, the laion ds - what do?
- notebook exploration
- filter descriptions by keywords
    - thigs like "one-shot"
- filter by length
- simple semantic analysis with a local LLM?
- some sort of audio analysis?
    - multimodal LLMs could come in handy here
    - or, simpler audio embeddings or even just classification models
    - some sort of "sfx" classifier?
    - the kick/snare/cymbal classifiers from [[Crash]] or [[DrumGAN]]

sounds good, embeddings would need to be launched on aws too
