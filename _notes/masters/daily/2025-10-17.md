## goals
pretty clear, tasks are listed in [[what do (masters)]] - on hold right now
next step would be metrics
## architecture
checkerboard artifacts? ([distill article](https://distill.pub/2016/deconv-checkerboard/))
- potential idea from the paper - using resize+convolution instead of transposed convolutions
- other than that should be ok, since stride divides the kernel size
- or not
- summarizing this in [[VAE architecture]]
- **another source**: dilation + kernel size?
    - [[MelGAN]]: "We make sure that the dilation grows as a power of the kernel-size such that the receptive field of the stack looks like a fully balanced (seeing input uniformly) and symmetric tree with kernel-size as the branching factor."
    - [x] make sure dilation + kernel size + strides are tuned to eachother in a way that doesn't produce checkerboard artifacts

discriminator
- preferably configurable
decomposition
- preferably configurable
