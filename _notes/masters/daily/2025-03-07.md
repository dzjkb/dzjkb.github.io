planning
"novelty" (research?) areas:
- primary:
    - diversity metrics
    - existing methods on new, texture-focused multilayered datasets
- secondary

what do
- [ ] list out [[thesis goals]] (and non-goals) for the thesis - potentially novel contributions
- [ ] [[thesis table of contents]] - first draft
- [x] organize the datasets collected so far on gdrive

later - probably start working on the repo to get the VAE running at least - basic tooling/libraries, helper functions
- [ ] sound read/write scripts
- [ ] exploration notebook
