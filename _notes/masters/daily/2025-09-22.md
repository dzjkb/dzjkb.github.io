## goals
- finish the [[Timeline chart.canvas|Timeline chart]] to get an overview of all the works
- choose target models/evaluations for comparison- [[thesis goals]]
- and then write out the [[experiments]]?

which models have the same assumptions => I can compare to them?
- **not** DDSP
- RAVE

as per comparisons from the newer papers:
- musicLM is a different domain
- RAVE compares to SING and NSynth (why such an old one?)
    - maybe because it's the closest in function - generating notes (music) based on conditioning vectors
    - not comparing to [[DDSP]] and [NSF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12088) (Wang 2019, a different one than Tacotron though) because both restrict the signal type - monophonic

ok candidates
- RAVE
- SING
- Parallel WaveGAN?
## misc
wait I've seen this?
[Generative timbre spaces: regularizing variational auto-encoders with perceptual metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08501)
it's goddamn IRCAM of course + the second guy from [[RAVE]] after Antoine
!!

wait and what about this - [Hierarchical generative modeling for controllable speech synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.07217)

I should definitely compare: global z vs. z as a sequence vs. global z with normalizing flows
- compare how - reconstruction quality
