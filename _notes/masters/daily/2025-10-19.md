## goals
pretty clear, tasks are listed in [[what do (masters)]] - on hold right now
next step would be metrics
## architecture

[Upsampling artifacts in neural audio synthesis (arxiv)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14356)
- transposed convolution, interpolation upsamplers, subpixel convolutions
    - all 3 are prone to artifacts

[[RVQGAN]] takeaways
- use their discriminators that are designed to reduce various artifacts
- snake activation function for periodic inductive bias
    - [[RAVE]] actually uses snake in v3 wtf
- discriminators are _critical_ for quality
    - "We find that adversarial losses are critical to both the quality of the output audio, as well as the bitrate efficiency. When training with only reconstruction loss, the bitrate efficiency drops from 99% to 62%, and the SI-SDR drops from 9.12 to 1.07."

**adding the discriminators**
- copy over MSD, MRD and MRSD from [[RAVE]] (or descriptor?)
- add discriminator step
- add the freeze/warmup/sth callback parameter step etc.
