### misc
oh no `torchaudio` has some sort of version mismatch
```
A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.2.4 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.
```
- [x] fix `torchaudio` version requiring numpy `1.x`, while `2.2.4` is installed
    - easier than I thought, literally just downgrading numpy, no other packages changed (maybe suspicious even?)
### Decoder
```
L_out = L_in*S - S - S - 2 + 2S - 1 + 1 + output_padding
L_out = L_in*S + output_padding - 2
```

just pretty much the reverse of the encoder, easy enough
### VAE
now to parametrize all this stuff
- [x] finish `VAE` - train/val step, logging, losses
### hooks
- validation?
- LR schedule?
- warmup?
### dataset
https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/generated/torchaudio.load.html#torchaudio.load
https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/tutorials/audio_io_tutorial.html

just returning the audio?
and applying the transforms, apparently [[RAVE]] does it's own transform classes w/ just a `__call__()` method, random apply/composition classes etc
potential issue - loading wavs too slow? does it cache automatically?
- [ ] add basic augmentations when instantiating `AudioDataset`
    - like normalizing audio? some kind of flips? crops?
