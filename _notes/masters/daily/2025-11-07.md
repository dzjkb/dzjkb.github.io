## goals
pretty clear, tasks are listed in [[what do (masters)]] - on hold right now
next step would be metrics
## experiments
ok so I got ~407 steps per epoch on graz
500 epochs should be like 200k steps?
lets do discrimination afte 300 epochs - 120k steps
`graz_v0.yml` callback config
## snake
bruv
see [[VAE architecture]]
one `alpha` per channel?? that's what [[RAVE]] does
in [[RVQGAN]] it looks like
```
# Scripting this brings model speed up 1.4x
@torch.jit.script
def snake(x, alpha):
    shape = x.shape
    x = x.reshape(shape[0], shape[1], -1)
    x = x + (alpha + 1e-9).reciprocal() * torch.sin(alpha * x).pow(2)
    x = x.reshape(shape)
    return x
```
and then pretty much the same class like in RAVE, doing one `alpha` per channel (but shaped `(1, dims, 1)` instead of `(dims, 1)`)
`(dims, 1)` would just make it work on the second to last dimension always - channels
## huh again
- metrics - FAD, MOS
- normalizing flows
- pqmf
- reproducing RAVE/MelGAN

normalizing flows and reproducing results - only after I got a full evaluation suite
MOS is a high cost end thingy though
pqmf not sure if it's necessary for the constrained usecase

so the next step would be metrics + datasets + diversity evaluation brainstorming (and tuning the discriminator training in the meantime)

ok lesgo - [[Frechet Audio Distance]]
## sidenotes
an online demo like this https://fadtk.hydev.org/ would definitely be a great addition to the thesis
