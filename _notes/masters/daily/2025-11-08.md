## goals
pretty clear, tasks are listed in [[what do (masters)]] - on hold right now
next step would be metrics
## experiments
graz w/ discriminator still running
## evaluations
metrics + datasets + diversity evaluation
- afterwards - reproducing results + normalizing flows

[[Frechet Audio Distance]]

ok idk about the FAD everyone just does MOS + qualitative analysis + other metrics not related to quality depending on usecase

[[diversity metrics]] - discrepancy
