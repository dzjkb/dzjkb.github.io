hello, [[what do (masters)]]?

would be really nice to get any model going
the minimum req would be
- [x] organizing data first
[[datasets]]
- just some sample packs and 2 irisarri albums for now

also
- [x] copy over relevant things from joplin to here
    - from notes around half of 2024-10 to half of 2024-11
    - exactly 2024-10-16 to 2024-12-13, not much happening Dec though
    - mainly about RAVE
copying over stuff from emacs? don't think that's necessary, just reach back there if I think I'll need it

check out Fugatto from nvidia?

[[RAVE]]
https://github.com/acids-ircam/RAVE/tree/master
https://github.com/acids-ircam/ddsp_pytorch

probably should get into:
https://github.com/Lightning-AI/pytorch-lightning

next?
- get a repo going, data loading etc
- notebook for exploration

new repo? wait I've already made one lol
need to use pytohn 3.10 to use cuda on gpu2 (hehe), what features would I be missing?
- type parameter syntax from 3.12 !!
- variadic generics, `Self` type, required/notrequired typeddict fields
- per-interpreter GIL
ok I can live without this stuff I guess eh

would be better to start with the model maybe? which would inform data loading, inspection etc
- [ ] basic model architecture and training script
