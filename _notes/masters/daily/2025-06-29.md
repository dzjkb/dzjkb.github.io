NaNs in L2 distance, is it just the mean of a totally silent `y`?
seems to be working, nice
nvm, still breaks but later, wtf
right it goes backward, numerator has to be positive too?

ok NaNs on convolution now
in the encoder `.forward()`, thrown by `F.conv1d()`
- [x] why NaN in `F.conv1d()` tho
### noise
oh boy time for some theory
[[ddsp]]
some [DSP book](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/dsp-book/dsp_book_Ch14.pdf) (chapter on FIR filters) might come in handy
- each of (impulse response, frequency response, step response) is a complete description of the filter and can be reconstructed from the other ones
- IR -> fft -> FR
- convolving the IR with a signal applies the filter
in ddsp it's fft -> mul -> ifft
