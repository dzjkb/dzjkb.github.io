## normalizing flows
ok ok ok ok

recap:
- the more flexible posterior is still regularized with KLD w.r.t. `N(0, 1)` - the desired prior distribution
    - KLD calculated in the `normalizing-flows` package, don't fully understand where that comes from yet
- why not use flows for the prior?
    - maybe because it can't be really learned?

next:
- examples in the wild - see "other reading" in [[normalizing flows]]

ok idk closest I got is conditional priors using flows
maybe I should just try?
which flows though?
## thesis overview
fuck ok I kind of like got it assuming I want to go into this normalizing flow shit?
but I'm kind of scared of sending it, seems just simple and possibly without potential
fk fk fk ok send after christmas
## next
- datasets - SFX, synths, ?
- add normalizing flows - which ones though?
