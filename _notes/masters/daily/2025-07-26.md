oh my god ok 2 weeks
what now
### nans
i fcing swear, no way to make this robust?
### dataset
maybe not right now? need to figure out what I'm actually after before adding more datasets, 2 is enough for now
### prior model
ok ok
### evaluations
literature review, writing down different methods
experiment plan?
table of content
goals/non-goals
### ok what do actually
- searching for evaluation methods used in similar papers, that is
    - [[ddsp]]
    - [[SoundStream]]
    - [[RAVE]]
    - [[MelGAN]]
    - [[musicLM]]
    - WaveNet
- what are their main goals?
- what are their secondary goals?
- focusing on the categories:
    - diversity
    - quality

maybe just adding normalizing flows could be the aim for this paper?
what would that improve? the prior?
the RNN already makes the prior significantly more expressive no?
might increase disentaglement though? the RNN prior is probably not very interpretable
