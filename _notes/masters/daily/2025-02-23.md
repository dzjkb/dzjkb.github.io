masters daily notes - as working logs, but separate from the stable context of the work (i.e. avoid situations where you copy things from one daily to the next)
the workflow should rather be copying stuff from the daily notes into other, proper notes

what do next?
planning stage
- elaborating on thesis chapters
- specifying goals and non-goals
- specifying what's novel
- reading

any concrete tasks?
- [x] do something bro
- [x] I swear to god

wow the dataview, amazing
