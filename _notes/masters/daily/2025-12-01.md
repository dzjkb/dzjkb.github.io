eeeeee
## decomposition
`PQMF` continued
impl by [pytorch_sound](https://github.com/AppleHolic/pytorch_sound/blob/master/pytorch_sound/models/transforms.py), inspired by impl at [[Parallel WaveGan]]
- look pretty much identical

why is the [[RAVE]] impl longer?
study it -> add it
- how is it going to interact with the single latent vector (no time dimension)?
## later
that phd vid watch
unconditional generation -> normalizing flows -> experimentsm/etrics
write to MaModrzejewski?
## MaModrzejewski review
would have to prepare a summary of the ideas (experiments+evaluations+concept) for him to judge probs?
