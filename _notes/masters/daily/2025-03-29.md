[[VAE architecture]] choices

**Encoder**
look at:
- [[RAVE]]
    - [x] document encoder/decoder architectures w/o params
    - [x] add parameters (stride, dilation) to the RAVE encoder graph
    - [ ] add parameters (stride, dilation) to the RAVE decoder graph
- [[ddsp]] - noise module
    - use it or not ???
    - probably not since there's no raw waveform generation element
- [[SoundStream]]?
    - [x] document SoundStream encoder/decoder architecture w/o params
        - actually they have nice graphs already, thankyou

both soundstream and rave follow a general
```
conv -> 4x encoder block -> conv
```
pattern, bumping channels 2x with each block

**Decoder**
same here, both soundstream and rave do a
```
conv -> 4x decoder block -> conv
```
pattern with the same type of decoder block w/ the same amount of dilation blocks, which looks suspiciously similar at this point - mightve been a direct inspiration (it's both google papers after all)

**what do**
- [x] find soundstream enc/dec details - weight norm?
