running this shit
### dataset
will probably need a better format instead of reading from file every time (maybe just caching would do?)
["Base class and presets for fast dataset creation inside IRCAM" (pypi)](https://pypi.org/project/udls/1.1.4/)
[lmdb](https://pypi.org/project/lmdb/)
### running
right fuck, can't batch audio with different lengths
just padding with zeros?
RAVE does a random crop to a fixed length, but we have way shorter examples, try padding

tensorboard only accepts mono audio wtf
ok works hnnnnggg
### ok now what
- [ ] log tensor statistics in intermediate steps
