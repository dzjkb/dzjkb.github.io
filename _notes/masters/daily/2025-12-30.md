## experiments
running, losses don't seem too optimistic for now but we gotta see

fuck it's overfittingggggggggggggggggg
val loss still rising after 800 epochs, bro
maybe it's the small latent loss? try imputing it at this step?

yep started falling immediately lessgooooo
## normalizing flows
read the theory paper?
and just experiment for now
## sem prez
ideas:
1. normalizing flows? density estimation, generative model classes etc.
2. or creative music AI

**normalizing flows**
papers?
- Density estimation using [[Real NVP]]
- [Variational Inference with Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05770)
- [Normalizing Flows for Probabilistic Modeling and Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.02762)
relate to VAEs, GANs

relate to masters - more expressive priors/posteriors
works?

**creative music AI**
papers?
- [[DrumGAN]]
- that paper about distilling knowledge not present in data
- the disentangling paper
hehe [thx mamodrzejewski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB6OekkZAA)
- ok he didn't make the "creative" vs "industry" distinction here
https://jvbalen.github.io/notes/waveform.html

cool stuff to show
- piano genie (magenta)
- [[RAVE]] birds (or other shit) translation
- [[RAVE]] motion sensor thingy - [yt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAIRf4nGgYI)
    - how tf is this mapped to 4 parameters
    - [nvidia forum explanation](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/embedded-realtime-neural-audio-synthesis-using-a-jetson-nano/236044)
    - and `nn~` [explained](https://github.com/acids-ircam/nn_tilde)
    - ok so this doesn't do prior generation, just raw decoding of the signal from the motion sensor
    - 4 parameters - 1 is total accel, 3 are gyro in each dimension
    - mapped to the 4 top directions from PCA probs?
    - nice
- that guys phd thesis?
- source separation - demucs?
## thesis overview
make a post on https://dzjkb.github.io?
[Jekyll post docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)
ok idk spending too much time on this
https://dzjkb.github.io/post/masters-overview

ok should I go into more detail here? maybe not?
maybe if it comes out in convo

ok fuc done sent aaaaaaaaaaa
## datasets
ok ok ok download/filter the LAION thing???
[[datasets]]
## misc
tf is this
https://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/868480/Castellanos_Allan.pdf;jsessionid=DCA4D511B55A8439862B6F32365242FC?sequence=3
someones masters about integrating RAVE into music production?
```
This study contributes to the growing field of AI-driven audio synthesis by offering
a practical guide on how to train and use RAVE models in music production. It
highlights the feasibility of training effective models on accessible platforms like
Windows 11, using mid-range consumer hardware such as the NVIDIA 4070 Ti
GPU. 
```
you gotta be fucking kidding me man
and I'm sitting here worrying about my shit
