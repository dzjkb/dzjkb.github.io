## experiments
running, losses don't seem too optimistic for now but we gotta see
## normalizing flows
read the theory paper?
and just experiment for now
## sem prez
ideas:
1. normalizing flows? density estimation, generative model classes etc.
2. or creative music AI

**normalizing flows**
papers?
- Density estimation using [[Real NVP]]
- [Variational Inference with Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05770)
- [Normalizing Flows for Probabilistic Modeling and Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.02762)
relate to VAEs, GANs

relate to masters - more expressive priors/posteriors
works?

**creative music AI**
papers?
- [[DrumGAN]]
- that paper about distilling knowledge not present in data
- the disentangling paper
## thesis overview
make a post on https://dzjkb.github.io?
[Jekyll post docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)
ok idk spending too much time on this

ok should I go into more detail here? maybe not?
maybe if it comes out in convo
