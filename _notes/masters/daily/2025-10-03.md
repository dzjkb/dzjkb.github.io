## goals
pretty clear, tasks are listed in [[what do (masters)]] - on hold right now
next step would be metrics
## architecture
first - weight norm, amp mod
then - make sure the checkerboard artifacts aren't an issue

l8r - will probably want to add both the discriminator and the decomposition, although ideally I'd achieve good results without them, but comparing with/without is rather necessary
