- side note: would be nice go actually learn some more math
- things leading up to probability/statistics
- uh
- side note 2: MJN, but also something volunteering for young people/old people/dogs?

**Variational Encoder**
see how the normalizing flow blokes do it
simple impl here https://github.com/fmu2/flow-VAE/blob/main/static_flow_conv_vae.py
might be good for inspiration - adding normalizing flows seems to be just another layer (in the static version, dynamic allegedly not worth it)

convs? [[ddsp]] doesn't actually use them for the encoder, uses MFCCs though
>is provided by audio MFCCâ€™s, which correspond to the smooth spectral envelope (Beauchamp, 2007) and are useful for estimating harmonic amplitudes.

ok that makes sense, since we don't restrict ourself to harmonic sounds anymore
just convs with batchnorm for [[RAVE]], also convs for the mean/variance heads instead of just linear layers

summed up in [[VAE architecture]]

**Decoder**
convs, see [[VAE architecture]] as well

**Data Loading**
