## goals
candidates so far:
- [[RAVE]]
- [[SING]]
    - or does this not make sense if RAVE compares favorably with SING already?
- [[DDSP]]
    - compare on a limited domain? why not, they didn't do so in RAVE though, maybe since it turned out unfavorable? or just unnecessary additional work?
- [[Parallel WaveGan]]
- [[MelGAN]]

metrics?
- [[Frechet Audio Distance]]
- MOS
## misc
