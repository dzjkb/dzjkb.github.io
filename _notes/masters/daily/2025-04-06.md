architecture cont.

**[[RAVE]]**
- decoder block length transform:
```
padding = r//2
stride = r
k = 2*r

L_out = (L_in - 1)*stride - 2*padding + kernel_size
L_out = (L_in - 1)*r - r + 2r = (L_in - 1)*r + r = L_in*r
```
with ratios (4, 4, 4, 2) this would give
```
L_in = 344
L_out = 344*128 = 44032
```

doesn't exactly match the `44100` samlping rate

**latent space rate**

forgot the signal is split into 16 bands
splitting a 48kHz signal would result in 16 3kHz signals
which would be encoded down to 23Hz, nice
and upsampled back to 2944Hz hmmmm
