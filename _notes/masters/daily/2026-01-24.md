## experiments
ok ok ok so
- the feature matching/adversarial losses still increase at a constant pace throughout the whole discrimination phase
- the discriminator loss starts plateauing at around ~2.5,
- reconstruction loss decreases at the same pace as previously
- audio quality barely changes/improves after discrimination phase
conclusions
- lower the discriminator loss a bit?
- increase capacity
- investigate tf is wrong with the validation reconstruction loss
fking stopping at 13 again what
- ok thx claude
- saddle points/local minima, try gradient clipping?
    - or just lower initial lr, try 5e-5
    - clipping to sth like 100?
- I could've figured this out myself really hm
- ok the gradients are reaching like over 1000??
- ok oh my fucking god
- [claude you did it again](https://claude.ai/share/81f02c17-e2ba-4f02-9545-2620d3632e72)
- and that fucking `softplus` from reparametrization is making all the difference?????
- `std = softplus(scale) + 1e-4` gives a minimum variance for each dimension, prevents encoder collapsing onto deterministic predictions
- failure mode: encoder learns deterministic predictions for some latent dimensions (high KL), variance too small to propagate gradient signal (?), encoder gives up and these dimensions enter a "posterior collapse" state, rip
running with logvar clamping between -5 - 10
ok still something totally breaks, the validation samples aren't trained at all
- maybe clamping doesn't change the gradient behavior enough?
- try scale instead of logvar parametrization for a smooth cutoff + only at the bottom
## dataset
- [x] buy an external HDD
download [[LAION-audio-630K]]
browse, filter, process

in the meantime, add the downloaded things to `snares2`
- in `uni/mgr/sample_packs` or `/media/Data/jp_dir`
    - FSDKaggle2018, random reddit stuff
