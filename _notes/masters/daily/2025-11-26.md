oh shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
this is big
ma boy [Mateusz Modrzejewski](https://mamodrzejewski.github.io/)
PhD from Politechnika in MIR, starting the first polish lab in the field
polish IRCAM pls (that's the goal)
loads of good info let's go
## potential relevant works
**drumgan**
[demo? (youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IET33sxcaRY)
oh shi, some drum synth works, might be very relevant
![[Pasted image 20251126210003.png]]
oh my god
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12073)
they're doing exactly the random generation vst thing for percussive sounds
https://cslmusicteam.sony.fr/prototypes/drumgan/
- exploration of a random plane in the latent space
integrated into Steinbergs backbone - [press release note](https://cslmusicteam.sony.fr/news/steinberg-releases-backbone-1-5-incorporating-drumgan/)
"which employs AI-driven technology to generate unique drum samples."
fuckin' hell
limitations - percussive (kick+snare+cymbal conditioning), mono, 16kHz

:eyes emoji:

how do they evaluate this??? !
loads of training data though, fuck

oh shii
[DarkGAN: Exploiting Knowledge Distillation for Comprehensible Audio Synthesis with GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01216)
not really relevant but super interesting
or maybe it is relevant - semantic controls for generation ????????

**loopgen**
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04466)
2025!
ok proper review of current SOTA models shiiiiiiiiiit
I should just be looking at wtf are the relevant people doing at this very moment
## relevant sites/groups etc
[c4dm at Queens Mary University of london](https://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk)
- Spotify, Apple etc execs mostly come from here
- top music&technology multi-disciplinary research group
https://musictechpoland.com
- ok ok nice, any AI people here?
- meetups
- startup accelerators?
[zaiks lab](https://www.zaikslab.tech/)
- supporting research projects?
- gotta reach out
- also giving accelerator vibes, has a nice map/database of startups
[pangenerator](https://pangenerator.com/info)
- new media art collective
[atem biennial](https://atem-biennial.space)
- "festival for audiovisual live coding & immersive arts"
- oh no, in the metaverse? please no
[noviki](https://noviki.net/about/)
- creative design and research studio
- hmmmm just something to follow I guess
- authors of [this (future fragments)](https://futurefragments.online/index.php/en/home-en/), not sure what's that about
## relevant tech
[nvtop](https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop) niceeeee gpu usage graphs in the cli
mtg-toolbox
## papers
ok ok ok nice

[MusGO: A Community-Driven Framework For Assessing Openness in Music-Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03599)
- not sure it's _that_ relevant but might give a nice overview of works in the field
[Towards Assessing Data Replication in Music Generation with Music Similarity Metrics on Raw Audio](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14364)
- sounds like it could be looking at embeddings + distances?
- assessing the quality of these metrics
- which would be very relevant for my diversity ideas
[Evaluating Fake Music Detection Performance Under Audio Augmentations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10447)
- ma boys work
- probably not relevant, but still interesting to see what fake music detection solutions are out there
[Sound texture synthesis using RI spectrograms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09497)
- texture synthesis - any datasets? insights? evaluation methods?
[Separating Explicit and Implicit Control for Expressive Neural Audio Synthesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDfq9bwS6jk)
- not a paper but a PhD thesis actually (youtube link)
- what are the attached papers?
- "We then explore methods to jointly learn explicit and implicit control spaces, first in a supervised setting, and later through AFTER, a framework designed for the unsupervised case" oh shit oh shit
- streamed less than a month ago u serious damn, IRCAM u freaks
- "The thesis concludes with several artistic collaborations" you can PhD that??? hell yes
- [COMBINING AUDIO CONTROL AND STYLE TRANSFER USING LATENT DIFFUSION](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00196)
    - "We presented a simple method to learn disentangled timbre and structure representation" yisss
- supervised by Esling right ofc dangggggggg
## thoughts
fuuuuuuuck a lot of new things
but also potential works to take inspiration from regarding _disentaglement_ and _diversity evaluation_

radial or spherical interpolation what's that?

what's next
- [[RAVE]] reproduction
- missing features: decomposition; unconditional generation; normalizing flows
- think about the metrics, IS, KID, embedding distances etc
