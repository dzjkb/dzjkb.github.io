## experiments
ok investigate
for some reason samples at epoch 500 sound better than 700, even though the reconstruction loss went down
some of the other losses went down and some of them up
- side note: does the latent loss give a random interfering signal? since the encoder isn't being trained anymore - but the gradients won't propagate to the decoder anyway
discriminator seems to be learning at a good pace, but the loss seems high
maybe it needs a larger learning rate? a schedule even?
until it's a high loss the feature matching signal is kind of random
and that would explain the adversarial loss going up

reminder: `graz_base.yaml` is `medium_capacity`

I mean I could just run it for more epochs and see what happens on the T4, but ~1-1.4$ per 2 hours isn't nothing
say I do another day, that's ~15$, and that's for just one "let's see what happens" run
a for a gridsearch I could be looking at a couple hundred pln
why am I not logging validation loss though? I can't even compare runs now
