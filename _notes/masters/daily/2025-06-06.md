get any training started
### dataset
dataset class finished, just basic transformations might be required?
### VAE
losses
training step
validation step
### losses
multiscale STFT windows used by RAVE:
```
core.MultiScaleSTFT:
    scales = [2048, 1024, 512, 256, 128]
    sample_rate = %SAMPLING_RATE
    magnitude = True
```

`magnitude == True` and `normalized == False`

I can just do `power=1` in `ta.transforms.Spectrogram` to get the magnitude, not sure I'll need niether complex nor power spectrograms

adding both log distance and linear distance, with linear being relative, not sure why?

multiband + fullband loss in RAVE, referring to the 16 bands from pqmf
same multiscale loss is calculated both on the bands and on the full reconstructed signal
just fullband in my case then

adversarial losses (possibly for later):
- feature matching - mean difference on features returned from the discriminator
- gan loss - `hinge_gan` on these features

ok done huh
### training
- [x] logging more stuff than train and val loss?
- [x] callbacks?
