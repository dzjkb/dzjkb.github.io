goddamn NaN losses again
- [x] why NaN losses though
	histograms would help probs

forgot about the noise DDSP module what
- [x] add ddsp noise module
- [x] add amplitude modulation

and training fucking hangs now are you for real
or actually goes very very slow - something waiting during validation?
might be the `add_histogram()` exception, bruh
### amp mod
oh shit this is waaaaaaay better
seems like the waveform module starts to learn a pretty clean sound from the start
~~how tf is audio still getting clipped during `.add_audio()` though~~
### prior
I don't need an RNN if I'm doing fixed length vectors of latents
how else can I learn a high dimensional distribution like that?
maybe I should have a different regularization? different distribution for each 128dim vector than a normal one?
### noise
I'm going to have to understand these filters for this one shit

### datasets continued?
- [x] prep a classical piano (debussy+chopin) dataset
