~ feeling a bit better

holy shit works actually
the validation audio samples are noisy and bitcrushed, but are beginning to sound like snares
40min per epoch - try 10x-ing epochs, should take 6:40

right
- [x] fix config logging (to run-specific dirs, not the root logging location)
- [x] fix histograms not showing up
    - and just breaking in general, shit
### anyway
the results seem to somewhat start resembling snares, what now?
- audio quality
    - hyperparam tuning - more epochs
        - beta warmup, dilations/ratios, ?
    - discriminative training
        - I'd rather not take this from RAVE if not necessary
        - what does [[SoundStream]] do?
    - augmentations
- instrumental datasets
    - some classical piano?
    - that goddamn irisarri
    - perc loops actually?
- prior generation
- evaluation methods
- normalizing flows
