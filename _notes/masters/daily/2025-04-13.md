very minimal implementation of soundstream - [gtihub](https://github.com/wesbz/SoundStream/blob/main/main.py) - apparently ran on the nsynth dataset, might serve as inspiration?

**upsampling rate mismatch**

so the `cc.get_padding()` function in the encoder gets passed the `stride` argument - `cc.get_padding(2 * r, r)`, but it's not used - maybe I have a different version?
no, downsampling is ok since we get the exact expected 23Hz
the rate would have to be exactly `23.4375` to get the expected 3000 though?
fuck idk

**initial model continued**

model + dataset loading etc
dataset - just torchaudio file loading?
```
A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.2.4 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

seriously
