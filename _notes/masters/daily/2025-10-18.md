## goals
pretty clear, tasks are listed in [[what do (masters)]] - on hold right now
next step would be metrics
## architecture
### checkerboard artifacts
oh shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
[Upsampling artifacts in neural audio synthesis (arxiv)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14356)
### discriminator
see how [[MelGAN]] and [[RAVE]] do it

wow lmao [[RAVE]] actually does take the discriminator from [[MelGAN]] authors
from https://github.com/descriptinc/descript-audio-codec to be precise
```
include "configs/descript_discriminator.gin"
```
in `v3.gin`

dense stuff, fuck

wait this is more cutting-edge generative audio modeling from 2023
[[RVQGAN]]
seems like RAVE was updated after release with the new discriminator
some potential takeaways?
- snake activation function for an inductive bias of periodicity?
## misc
jfc, dystopian stuff from melgan creators
ugh
