Modrzejewski is on board
lesssgooooooooooo
"similar to [[DrumGAN]]", but expanding on the datasets size + implicit features sounds good
## experiments
the overfitting jeez why
ok maybe the discriminative learning will help
but I really need to speed it up
- smaller discriminator network? I've already reduced periods + fft sizes
- could also reduce `BANDS`, not sure what place would be the least sensitive to a decrease in resolution
at least the embedding logging works, looks reasonably spaced out
not sure I can read more from this

also - potential discrepancies that might need to be worked out
- discriminator "skipped features"
- getting the snake activations going :cry:
- !! strides not needing to fking divide the stuff nicely

??
- for some reason the validation step got reset fuck
- and the validation audio sample totally changed idk what's happening
- ok shit I manually set `validation_epoch`, this should be in the state somehow
