[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05106)

some 3rd party naive impl [here (github)](https://github.com/AppleHolic/multiband_melgan)
- ohh uses PQMF impl from some `pytorch_sound` lib
- it's the same dude, [pytorch_sound (github)](https://github.com/AppleHolic/pytorch_sound)
- ml engineer at supertone inc ([profile](https://github.com/AppleHolic))
# decomposition
based on [DurIAN: Duration Informed Attention Network For Multimodal Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01700)
- Appendix A
- links some paper from 94
no code provided, neither for melgan nor for durian

oh wait [[Parallel WaveGan]] does pqmf???
