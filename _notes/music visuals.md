color coding notes
https://chromatone.center/
harmonies - blends of colors
would be doable in sth like touchdesigner probs???
spectrum analysis -> each freq (band) has an associated color -> blend
possibly split the screen vertically according to octave
blend between octaves
and some geometric transformations to create shapes of some sort instead of a color blob
