is how I develop my [[thoughts]]

### notes
pretty self-explanatory eh?

I write daily notes in [joplin](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin) because of the CLI + text file combination
- daily driver - journals, todos, keeping track of work

I write pretty notes about feelings with sketches in my sketchbook

and now I'm working on my digital garden in [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), where I also take notes regarding my masters thesis

### poetry (and prose?)
intriguing
how about some courses - [Pisanie (fb)](https://www.facebook.com/pisaniekreatywne)

### Nika's notebook
answering questions about our childhood, worldview/feelings growing up, etc.
fascinating how you can start recalling things you thought are long gone once you put your mind to it
due 2024-12
update: ok Nika doesn't really plan on reading this? eh
still fun though
