- min. **8 weeks** of supplementing
- in case of joint pain min. **6 months** (oh boy)
- not right before or after workouts due to oxidizing properties
- need to have vitamin C with it for absorption

- apparently a vegan option is supplementing aminoacids for collagen production, which can be sourced from:
    - soy (tofu, tempeh)
    - black beans and other strączki
    - seeds
    - nuts
- which are all things I already eat
- maybe not enough?
