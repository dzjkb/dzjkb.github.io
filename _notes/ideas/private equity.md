differences:
- private equity - investing in/taking over private companies (sometimes public ones), very long term, inflexible, involves managing said companies
- hedge funds - shorter term, liquid, often using stock market tools, shorting, leverage etc
- VC - investing in startups/small companies, not that involved in managing (I think?)
