gift from Jim regarding the upcoming Peru trip
Peruvian author, Claudia Salazar Jimenez, translated by Tomasz Pindel

tells the story of the [Shining Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shining_Path), a Maoist terrorist organization active 1980 - 2000 in Peru, through the lens of several women involved - a renowned photograph, a village girl, an aid worker(?) turned high-ranking member of the revolution => tells the woman perspective in general

wow, just wow
it's heavy
but the way it is written
the descriptions, the language, the way these three stories are interwoven
how the narrative builds up from scattered pieces
the gripping, devastating depictions

## 2025-02-18 update
finished it after the trip, just several pages

amazing
having the context of just being in Peru, visiting the Shining Path museum, some sites, makes the experience very much more real
rooted in reality
and the events being relatively recent
it's a very specific situation to read a book with context like this, great experience
