this is going to be a big one
I like it so far, but the style is very dense and confusing at times
which is allegedly an intentional, stylistic tool to illustrate the "darkness" and "entaglement" we should embrace in our perception of the world
going into poetry and aesthetical impressions rather than clear merit
which does fit into the posited mental shift I guess
ok sure but does that really mean you have to write it like that
ah, maybe it's just the missing knowledge of modern philosophy
