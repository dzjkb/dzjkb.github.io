## Summary
An overview of the biggest failures of the aid industry in the last several decades

The book is centered around the ethical dillema of providing help to everyone in need (=> saving lives) even if the morally questionable side somehow benefits in the process vs. withholding help because of political considerations. The original Red Cross manifest asserts that help should be "politically neutral", and that given a dillema of
- helping people in need but as a result prolonging the conflict, vs
- not helping and letting the conflict end sooner (potentially in a deadlier fashion)
aid organizations should always choose the first option. The author argues that it's actually impossible to be politically neutral when providing aid and that aid campaigns mindlessly entering conflict zones can result in substantially worse outcomes. Especially guilty of this are so-called MONGOs (My Own NGO) which don't have the experience to understand these dynamics and often have their own interest in mind rather than of the actual people in need.

## Opinion
Fascinating book, fantastic prose. Very dark at times, since it goes into some of the bigger and deadlier conflicts in modern Africa. The author was involved in many of the aid operations described and gives really interesting and insightful first-hand accounts of related events.
A must-read for people working in the aid industry.
