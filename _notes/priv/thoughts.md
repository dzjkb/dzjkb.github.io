gathered, scattered

writing thoughts down is such a powerful thing
not to document them
but to develop them
to grasp them in all their opaqueness and complexity
to flesh out theories of your own mind just like you would working on a scientific paper
to reason, adjust, question, follow, examine
to capture all the experiences and states you go through, ephemeral, but at the same time shaping who you are
to capture all the fleeting thoughts that might shape up into something substantial in the future
