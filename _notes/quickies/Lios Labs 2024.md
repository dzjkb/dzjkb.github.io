one of my [[experiences]]

what an amazing experience
## The collective experience
the communal, collective experience - makes me imagine how different the way we live could look
and what our current way of living is missing
just the feeling of a herd, community was a fascinating experience in itself
non-hierarchical, sharing resources, with everyone actively and voluntarily working towards keeping things running
spontaneous collaborations, initiatives
collective openness to emotions, everyones "energy"

## Perfo
turned out great
the setup did it's job
sounds flowed smoothly, ideas came quite naturally
improvising melodies and harmoniesiiiii came naturally too
the circumstances were great, people drifting away on blankets under a tent
dim purple light

## Rituals
This should probably be a part of the collective experience
also something missing from the system we live in
collective rituals in everyday life
gathering in a circle, shaking things off
spontaneous unconstrained expression, sounds, movement
collective processing of emotions - grieving
- this is a big one
- something we're definitely imissing
- something that's super powerful
- processing the grief of one person in a ~20 person group
- beautiful

## People
A different breed of person than I'm used to
open, expressive, very comfortable in their bodies
inspiring
