Making a score for Mateusz's - Tomczi's friend from WSF (Warsaw Film School) - personal project, a short film he's directing. The idea is to submit it to various festivals.
## meeting 2025-01-26
- a child is being modified physically/genetically/? to set it up for success in a highly non-ethical way, this isn't precisely defined how
- except that he gets harmed by his mutations in moments he's not focusing on success or not achieving it
- main motif (leitmotif) being the sound of a music box, children toys, a bit creepy
- develops into ambient/noise dramatic music
- music box leitmotif signifying he's going to get hurt
- dialog moments - no music, slight ambience perhaps
- culmination moment once he realizes he's not getting hurt while working at night, showing his mutation
- glitches very much welcome
