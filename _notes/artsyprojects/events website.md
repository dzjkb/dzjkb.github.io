name
- iwencikiwwa.pl ?
    - bought this and iwencikiwwa.net

## hosting
https://dhosting.pl
- wordpress/drupal, also seems expensive (280pln for a year), overkill?
- https://static.app
    - 60$ a year, which means around 220pln yearly
- https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/pages/
    - supports frameworks and just static
        - maybe jekyll? [all frameworks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/)
    - takes the website from a github repo? nicee
    - pro is 25$/month, but the free tier should work?
        - 500 builds per month, 100 custom domains, 1 concurrent build
        - "All plans come with unlimited sites, seats, requests, and bandwidth."

ok went with cloudflare
easy af, just static html from the github repo
and it works!?

## adding entries
just keep them in the GH repo, csv or sth
some sort of buckets in the future? maybe, but one entry is like kilobytes at most
## further ideas
- palestine help - get involved page
- subsections, like https://iwencikiwwa.net/teatr
