## pro tips
- ATMs
    - https://wise.com/gb/blog/atms-in-peru
    - ~~Scotia bank no fees, others probably ~several dollars~~
    - ~~BCP 5$ fee, recognizes visa, same with Scotia bank~~
    - atm locator https://www.visa.com/locator/atm
    - sum1 [saying](https://www.reddit.com/r/PERU/comments/6bpofy/exchanging_currency_best_or_cheapest_atm_fees_as/) it's no fees in BCP and Scotia? suspicious thread though
    - [ok so](https://www.reddit.com/r/PERU/comments/1992szd/insane_atm_fees_in_peru_for_international_cards/) "used to be BCP but not anymore in 2023, Banco de la Nacion only now"? and still scotiabank
    - !! BN ATMs are called MultiRed, 2024 fees below ![sc](/assets/img/peru_atms.png)
- don't leave baggage unattended, don't let people carry it, of course
- avoid buses in mountain areas - like machu picchu - due to wet season and dangerous roads
- negotiate prices (e.g. cuzco taxis should be 5zł to get anywhere)
- watch out for local food yeah
