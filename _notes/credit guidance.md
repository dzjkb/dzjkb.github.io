- in short - forcing banks to direct investment into specific sectors
- precedence - has been used before in the post-war period
- can also be used to fight inflation by targeted regulation of demand (alongside possibly price controls) instead of broad methods like interest rates (which can have devastating effects and are proven to be ineffective)
- limitations - companies can still invest their profits into the damaging sectors, guidance isn't a substitute for regulations, public investment mechanisms still needed
- but what about market neutrality? maintaining stability => preventing crisis and risks is more important

seems like a great idea - are there people who lobby for this? any movements in polish/european politics? REAL on an european level, what else?
