finally selling Wilanów, what do with the cash? options:
1. ~~mortgage, warsaw flat~~
    1. still would need like 400-500k mortgage at least, even over 20 years it could be like 2k a month
    2. even renting it out would be a large commitment and in the long run cost a lot, nullyfing most of the gains
    3. make some sort of quantitative analysis of this?
    4. horrifying perspective really
2. invest in bonds, maybe index funds
    1. actually a better investment than a flat
    2. if we treat the flat purely as an investment
    3. no cost, potentially higher risk, not a bad idea
3. ~~cheaper flat in Łódź, rent it out~~
    1. no mortgage, 400k is enough for a reasonable flat somehwere in the city center
    2. Łódź allegedly rising in value
    3. no mortgage -> no costs
    4. investment + monthly dividends

Łódź does sound like a great option, especially if I could rent it out to people I know/Nika knows

ok bonds actually
# bonds
can buy through PKO or Pekao, nice

calculator spreadsheet from [this bloke - marcin iwuc](https://marciniwuc.com/obligacje-indeksowane-inflacja-kalkulator/)
(expert?) forecasts 3 years forward from [this september NBP report](https://nbp.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025Q2_SPFs.pdf)
- I mean, why not trust it?
- not that I necessarily want to but I don't know how to evaluate this
lots of valuable [info from marcin again](https://marciniwuc.com/obligacje-skarbowe/#fundusze-obligacji-nie-moga-nabywac-detalicznych-obligacji-skarbowych)

the 3 year ones seem best? since rates/inflation going down -> the varying rate bonds will have less return, but the 3 year constant rate ones will have the high one
- note: they're calculated from the WIBOR 6M index, but that's also going down (interbank rate?) so yeah still the same story
19% tax from the profit goddamn
still, 3 years best, lesgo?
