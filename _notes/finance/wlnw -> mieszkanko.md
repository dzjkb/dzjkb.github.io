finally selling Wilanów, what do with the cash? options:
1. mortgage, warsaw flat
    1. still would need like 400-500k mortgage at least, even over 20 years it could be like 2k a month
    2. even renting it out would be a large commitment and in the long run cost a lot, nullyfing most of the gains
    3. [ ] make some sort of quantitative analysis of this
    4. horrifying perspective really
2. invest in bonds, maybe index funds
    1. actually a better investment than a flat
    2. if we treat the flat purely as an investment
    3. no cost, potentially higher risk, not a bad idea
3. cheaper flat in Łódź, rent it out
    1. no mortgage, 400k is enough for a reasonable flat somehwere in the city center
    2. Łódź allegedly rising in value
    3. no mortgage -> no costs
    4. investment + monthly dividends

Łódź does sound like a great option, especially if I could rent it out to people I know/Nika knows
