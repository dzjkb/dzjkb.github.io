# discussion
Burry's arguments
- oversupply without revenue backing it up
- overstated revenue (https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai_docs/)
    - changed GPU depreciation
- massive GPU buying backed by only debt and VC financing, since the profits are still negligble (and definitely not enough to cover the expenses so far)
