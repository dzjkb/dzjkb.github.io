god I feel like
calm
QED is going well
artsy projects are done for now, working on ideas and next steps
mgr is starting, I think I can focus on that now
Kasia is well, there, we're slowly regaining trust for eachother, but I'm not 100% sure I'd want to be with her now, and I'm not grieving over it
some fun trips and playing opportunities are lined up
it's... nice

maybe except that I'm still missing intimacy
romantic connection
would be nice to reach out and find it
feels doable
although I'm still, to be honest, thinking about Kasia
there's a large part of me that does want to be with her
and thinks that we're made for eachother
I'm not over it yet
and I wish it would be possible for it to work out
but what part of me is that?

so...?
- masters
- books
- reading about notetaking or other clipped stuff
- further explore kaivo
- watch inside out
