I'm so torn apart
(might've been the sex huh)
I miss her so badly
but I don't want to miss her
I want to be free of this
but I also wish we could just be happy together
and spend the rest of our lives side by side
brave enough to take both of our issues head on
understanding enough for eachother to make it possible
that's when I remember the beautiful moments, the love
playfulness, intimacy, connection
our love for eachother runs so deep
easily the best moments of my life
but there's so much I wouldn't want
the aggression, dismisiveness of my feelings
hurtful comments, adversity, inconsistency, constant doubt
keeping me on the edge, refusing to communicate
I remember all the pain and bullshit I had to go through
and I know this would just be bad for me
I accept Kasia the way she is, with all her issues
but I still can't free myself from her
from this idea

might be my own shortcomings
I'm sort of detached from reality now
missing intimacy, stressing about projects
feeling guilty getting hooked on hollow knight
falling behind on things I want to do
makes the whole situation hit harder
where's the vision

where's the intimacy
should I start searching?
that would be the final stage of moving on
sealing the whole ordeal
I'm definitely not there yet
not ready for that
stuck in this limbo
fuck

what do I
- sewing
- napieprzanko
- fringe - sd cards, drive around
