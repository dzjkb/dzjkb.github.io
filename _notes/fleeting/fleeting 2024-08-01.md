ok it's the situation
I'd do something, not really in the mood to do sth reaally productive like
- masters
- benefit stuff
- music producing / ppooll setup
- radical listening conceptualizing
not really in the mood to
- read,
- draw
- write
- develop EP ideas, graphical scores
- plec ideas
- read clipped stuff
either
I could !
- look at traveling ideas, plane ticket prices
- watch something - inside out
- explore vsts? kaivo
- analog camera??
- look at chains?
- vinted?

how can I develop my [[mood page]] with this in mind
sup with the number painting kit for babcia btw

sucks 'cause I have this feeling I should be doing shit
- I think I might have it when the work thing I'm currently doing is in a messy state and I haven't made much progress throughout the day
- in days I do make substantial progress, get some definite part of a project done, I have less pressure like this
- also other projects weighing on my mind like the benefit definitely add to the feeling
- or that I have to call someone and get something else done, tomorrow or even in the coming week, not now
- uh

maybe having a clearer definition of what I want to achieve during work for a given day would help
but I have days where it's messy and it doesn't look like this
ah whatttttt then
