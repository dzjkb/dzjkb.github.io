this is an important topic to develop
things I read watch everyday
places I look to when I'm impulsively looking for something to redirect my attention to

#### social
not much to do/modify here, ig/facebook - pure entertainment
very impulsive, would be nice to cut down on this
#### youtube
also not much to do here, pure entertainment, I feel it's under control though

## current feeds
- NYT morning briefing
    - main source of news pretty much
    - valuable, nice summary, keeps me updated
- Hackernews
    - sort of entertainment, reach compulsively when bored
    - random interesting tech news, valuable discussion
    - sometimes get important tech updates

and that's pretty much it huh

## ideas
1. the app - what was it called - feedly?
    - never got into it, why?
    - articles need a lot of involvement
    - and might have been curated in a way that isn't ultimately interesting for me?
2. twitter
    - would be nice for AI/tech stuff
    - twitter itself is worth boycotting though
3. [kbin](kbin.social)
    * too few people, poor content
    * maybe if I find the right "subreddits" though
4. reddit
    * also worth boycotting, rip
    * some quality subreddits are probably still there, but it was always sifting through shit, I need more targeted stuff
5. something local
    - dziennik ustaw? heh
    - MJN
    - https://oko.press !
    - panoptykon
1. NEWSLETTERS
    - this might be a big one I'm overlooking
    - convivial society, psyche.co, that Elise girl are all nice
    - but I imagine there are some newsletters aggregating AI news and the likes
    - shit the morning briefing is a newsletter afterall
    - https://alphasignal.ai
    - https://lastweekin.ai/
    - newsletters aren't exactly there when I reach for them, though
    - could be if I make a separate gmail folder for these
2. podcasts
    - raport o stanie Å›wiata ! I could be listening to this more often

## what am I looking for anyway
maybe I don't actually need anything like this
most important stuff reaches me and I have things to do/read if I have the time

maybe I actually need some better semi-conscious timesink, like reddit was?
valuable content 

targeted vs timesink feeds, important distinction
time sinks:
* ig, reddit, hackernews
targeted:
* feedly (politics), twitter (AI/tech)?
* newsletters
