jezu ten język - LLMy? lol
serio mogło by mieć sens
- no infinite scrolling
- no tags/metadata of any sorts attached to the entries
https://isap.sejm.gov.pl ju lepiej
ale wciąż niezbyt dla laika, bez tagów ani nic

what's the sota of looking through this though, any lawyers?

https://www.sejm.gov.pl/ - there's a calendar, voting records, schedule, news
- website from fucking 2002 least accessible shit, starting from even just the font size
- the bills themselves are PDFs, no tags, summaries, easy ways to view
    - I'd imagine software to effectively search through bills like this could be a big business, something like this has to exist already

https://skrotpolityczny.pl oh shit oh shit kind of what I was thinking about????
totally room for collaboration
- but the ads bro please
### info that should be more available
- sejm calendar
- current issues
    - like ones that are going to be voted on next?
- votings with exact summaries of who voted how
