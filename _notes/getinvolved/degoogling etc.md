# (done) spotify -> tidal
https://zoemcpherson.xyz/MOVING
https://www.tunemymusic.com/ for moving playlists

where?
- YT - want to degoogle anyway
- Apple - nah
- Amazon - please
- Tidal - library might be lacking? ethically seems ok
    - majority owned by block inc. which is owned by Jack Dorsey - twitter co-founder, co-founder of bluesky, generally seems nice
    - https://pitchbook.com/profiles/investor/106207-30#overview
- Qobuz?? tf is this
    - not available in PL but available in e.g. Chile, Argentina, Colombia, come on
    - VPNs or sth?

- [x] experiment - move playlists to a Tidal free version or sth, see how many tracks fall out
    - ok we doing this

Tidal it is?
tracks that fell out - can I save this log anywhere
- yes, csv
- only 8/550 tracks missing from the breakcore playlist, surprising
- might be because a lot of them are from the same label or sth?
- 50 tracks missing from the queue though oooops
    - alberich - nato uniformen
    - brian hodgson
    - everything else is there though, surprisingly
- some tracks from domek #9
- one from like this ;-;
selected missing artists I'd want to see:
- kaho matsui
- yuragi
- kinokoteikoku
- claire rousay
- kenji
- isnaj dui
- 7038634357
- pedestrian deposit
- cindy lee, max winter, hm
- Petite Suite: VII. Nocturne - Masataka Yoshihashi

supplement this with bandcamp I guess?
or other streaming platforms, using several concurrently

ok 60days trial let's see how this works out, look at:
- suggestions
- workflow
- songs I can/can't find, compare with spotify on the fly
# instagram
tough, look into this https://pixelfed.social though?
network effect though
# mail
proton probs
what would I need to move?
- subscriptions
- accounts, fuck
just having it for new mail would be good enough for starters anyway
https://account.proton.me/mail/signup?ref=mailhero - 4$/month
# drive
tough one, loads of options probably though

https://jottacloud.com it is
- has both archiving (like gdrive storage) and automatic backup functionality
- with desktop apps for mac/win and a linux CLI!? even an AUR package
- and a photos app to replace google photos, hell yes
lesgo
- https://docs.jottacloud.com/en/articles/1437238-archiving-files-and-folders-with-jottacloud-cli
### moving
- DL -> move all gdrive stuff into the archive
- setup homedir linux backup
- install photos app, do backup, remove everything from gphotos
    - gphotos has stuff I don't longer have on my phone though
    - would need to re-download them to upload them again? huh
# phone
graphene OS
main problems:
- many unavailable apps
- possible to sandbox play services -> use stuff like maps though !? lesgo
